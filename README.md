# Introduction
In this case study, I will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.I work for a consumer finance company that specializes in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to decide whether to approve or reject it based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

-> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

-> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., they are likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company.

The data given in the repository contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’. The aim is to identify patterns indicating that a person is likely to default, which may be used to deny the loan, reduce the loan amount, lend (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of defaulting.
